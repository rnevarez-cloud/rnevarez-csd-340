            <p class="intro">
                <span class="sentence">My name is Ricardo Nevarez, and I was born on August 16, 2000. </span>I originally grew up in Wilmington, OH, and am currently located in the Cincinnati Metropolitan area. I've been a student at Bellevue Univeristy since 2020, and I am currently studying for my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I have worked with technology ever since I was a kid, and I have over 5 years of experience in the IT field.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first endeavor into information technology from an education standpoint was at Laurel Oaks in Wilmington, OH. At Laurel, I learned the fundamentals of information technology, including how to work with computers, servers, and networking equipment. We also learned how to work with Windows and Linux, with some brief introductions to web development using HTML and CSS. I actually obtained two certifications for HTML and CSS:
                <ul>
                    <li>98-383:MTA: Introduction to programming using HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>98-375:MTA: HTML Application Development Fundamentals</li>
                </ul> 
                Through Laurel Oaks, I was also able to compete in regional, state, and national competitions to showcase my HTML and CSS skills through the Business Professionals of America. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating from Laurel Oaks, I attended Southern State Community College in Hillsboro, OH to complete my Associate's degree in Information Technology. At Southern State, I learned more about networking and troubleshooting. During my Spring term, I interned at a local hospital in their IT department. During my time there, I was able to get hands-on experience with networking equipment, servers, and troubleshooting.
            </p>
            <p>
                After my time at the hospital, I landed a full-time job for a software company in the higher education sector. I worked in various areas in their Managed Services division, gaining experience in managing servers, troubleshooting, and working with clients across the world. I played a major role in the company's implementation of Jira Service Management, which included developing many scripts to automate tasks and improve workflows. During October 2025, I was approached for a new role at a different company. It was scary, but I decided to make the change to work as a Site Reliability Engineer. In this role, I am also working on a myriad of projects, including automation. Outside of work, I also worked on an Azure cloud project to showcase my skills in cloud computing and web development.
